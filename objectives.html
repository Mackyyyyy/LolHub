    Neautral Objectives or Objectives in short are an essential part of League of Legends. These powerful neautral monsters are found in the middle of the map.
    These monsters require teamwork to destroy, but offer powerful bonuses when captured. We call them Elemental Drakes or in short Dragons/Drakes. Each having
    its own unique effects and attributes. Part of the objectives are structures, which includes the turrets and inhibitors. The most important thing or objective
    is in Leauge of Legends is to destroy the nexus of the enemy team. Through taking objectives(Dragons and Structures) you and your team are increasing
    your chance to win the game and claim that victory. These objectives can be achieve with your team or you can take it by yourself if you are strong enough.
    At the end of the day Objectives is a very important aspect of the MOBA game genre specifically for the game we chose which is League of Legends or LOL.
    And in this page I will go deeply and thoroughly explore these objectives in game.

    <h3>In Summary the Benefits of Dragon Slayer</h3>
    <p></p>
    The stacking buffs provided by Dragon Slayer Dragon Slayer grant powerful effects which boost the overall strength of champions that are empowered by them.
    <p></p>
    <b>CLOUD DRAKE'S</b> buff speeds up a team as they move across the map faster than their enemies can.
    It gives a team enough time to head towards an important objective and gain control over it.
    The decreased slow effectiveness also helps with outrunning a chase.
    <p></p>
    <b>HEXTECH DRAKE'S</b> buff greatly increases the attack output of a team as their cooldowns come up quicker and their attacks come out rapidly.
    <p></p>
    <b>INFERNAL DRAKE'S</b> buff becomes more and more effective as a game continues as a team builds up their stats,
    with the buff giving even more stats which in turn leads to a massive boost in attack power.
    <p></p>
    <b>MOUNTAIN DRAKE'S</b> buff toughens up a team and allows them to take more extended fights, making it difficult for the opposition to deal with.
    <p></p>
    <b>OCEAN DRAKE'S</b> buff restores tons of health after having taken lots of damage.
    It is particularly useful for taking down an objective after a skirmish as the team will restore their health overtime and be healthy in time for the next fight.
    <p></p>
    All Dragons/Drakes mentioned above are all active dragons you will see ingame or in the Summoners Rift.

    <p>Baron Nashor will activate an ability once every 6 basic attacks. Baron's first ability will be random. However, all abilities after the first may be predicted;
        Baron Nashor's ability rotation is cyclical (ex. Acid Pool > Acid Shot > Tentacle Knockup > Acid Pool).
        If there are more units behind Baron Nashor than in front of him, he will activate the area-of-effect rear attack instead.
    </p>
    <dt>
 
        <li>ACID POOL: After winding up for 2 seconds, Baron Nashor spits out 3 pools of acid in a cone in front of him,
            landing over 0.75 seconds and dealing 10% AD magic damage to all champions upon impact as well as creating a field for 2.5 seconds that
            slows those within by 50%.
        </li>
 
        <li>ACID SHOT: After winding up for 2 seconds, Baron Nashor spits acid down along a straight line over 2 seconds, dealing 20% AD magic damage to all units it hits.</li>
   
        <li>TENTACLE KNOCKUP: Baron Nashor summons a tremor beneath the target's location that erupts with a tentacle after 1.25 seconds,
            dealing 25% AD magic damage to units within and Airborne icon.png knocking them up for 1.25 seconds. Units near the edge of the area are also slightly knocked away.
 
        </li>
 
        <li>AREA-OF-EFFECT REAR ATTACK: Baron Nashor erects a cluster of spikes behind him, dealing 50% AD physical damage to units within the area and
            stunning them for 0.5 seconds.

    <h4>Turrets, also called towers, are heavy fortifications that attack enemy units on sight. Turrets are a core component of League of Legends.
        They deal damage to enemies and provide vision to their team, allowing them to better control the battlefield.
        Turrets target one unit at a time and deal heavy damage.
        Teams must destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into enemy territory.
 
        There are 11 turrets per team on Summoner's Rift.</h4>

        <dt>
 
            <li>TURRET PLATING: Outer turrets have large stone shields attached called plates. Plates are segments of the turret's health. Turrets start with five plates, each with 1000 health, meaning that they start with 5000 health. When a champion destroys a plate, they and nearby allies get a gold reward. However, the turret then gains damage resistance, thus becoming slightly harder to destroy. Plates disappear 14 minutes into the game, along with their extra damage resistance.</li>
 
            <li>PASSIVE: Grants -25 / 10 / 45 / 80 / 115 (based on current health) bonus armor and bonus magic resistance.</li>
 
            <li>PASSIVE - BULWARK: When a turret has its health reduced to 4000, 3000, 2000, and 1000 health; it gets a stack of Bulwark for 20 seconds. Each stack grants 0 − 180 (based on nearby enemy champions) bonus armor and bonus magic resistance, up to a maximum of 0 − 720 (based on nearby enemy champions) resistances at 4 stacks. This value changes dynamically depending on the number of alive enemy champions within Range model.png 850 range of the center of the turret.</li>
 
            <li>Plates take 17% reduced damage from minions and ranged champions.</li>
 
            <li>Destroying a plate grants 160 gold</li>
 
            <li>The top and mid outer turrets receive a FORTIFICATION bonus for the first five minutes of each game.</li>

    <h3>Inhibitors are structures that prevent super minions from spawning in the respective same lane. Inhibitors have 4000 health,
        15 health regeneration per second, 20 armor, and 0 magic resistance.
    </h3>
 
    <p></p>
 
    <h4>-Super minions are powerful minions with melee range. They only spawn on lanes where enemy inhibitors are destroyed, and stop spawning when the inhibitor respawns. While super minions are spawning, no siege minion will spawn in that lane.</h4>
       
<p></p>
 
<h5>Each team has 3 inhibitors on Summoner's Rift in each of their bases, of which at least one inhibitor must be destroyed to render the Nexus and its defending turrets vulnerable to being attacked (the Nexus will be invulnerable as long as one of its turrets or all 3 inhibitors are standing). Every inhibitor is protected by a turret that makes that inhibitor invulnerable; destroying the turret makes the inhibitor vulnerable.</h5>
 
<p></p>
 
<h5>Once a team's inhibitor is destroyed, the enemy's Nexus will begin spawning a super minion in the waves set in the respective lane, replacing the siege minion in its place if applicable. If all 3 of a team's inhibitors are destroyed, it will instead spawn two super minions in each lane, per wave.</h5>
 
<p></p>
 
<h5>Destroyed inhibitors respawn after 5 minutes, therefore stopping the opposing Nexus from spawning any more super minions.</h5>

<h2>Notes</h2>
 
<dt>
 
    <li>Inhibitors do not have any special buffs or effects.</li>
    <li>Armor penetration has no effect on an inhibitor's armor.</li>
    <li>The damage dealt to an inhibitor with a basic attack is the sum of the Attack damage icon.png base attack damage, plus the higher of bonus attack damage and 60% of ability power.
        If 60% of a champion's ability power is greater the amount of their bonus attack damage, the attack's damage converts from physical damage to magic damage.
    </li>
    <li>When the announcer notifies that either yours or the enemy's inhibitor will respawn soon, said inhibitor will respawn in 15 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>In Summoner's Rift, destroying an Inhibitor will spawn a Super Minion in each wave for the next 8 minion waves. Usually two minion waves before the Inhibitor completely recovers will not have any Super Minions.</li>
    <li>In Howling Abyss, destroying the Inhibitor will spawn a Super Minion in each wave for the next 10 minion waves.</li>
