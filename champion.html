<h5>Our favorite champions and why we main them</h5>
<p>
When League of Legends was first released back in 2009, there
were 40 champions, and from there, new champions have continuously been
added. With a current roster of 159 champions, it’s difficult to pick
your main, a champion who you truly enjoy and love. Here we share our
favorites to shed light on these champions and hopefully inspire you to
pick your own as well.

<h6> <p style="font-size:30px">Netzero / Thresh, The Chain
Warden</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHB0zRwM9bE"

<p> <em>"Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my
ears."</em></p>
<p>Brimmed with spite and hatred, this devilish abomination
fills fear into the hearts of enemy players across the map, but
surprisingly, this champion is not at all capable of single handedly
carrying games. But instead offers a more supporting role of saving
teammates in precarious situations with his lantern, and he could
always fulfill the role of being a grim reaper to those who are foolish
enough to enter into the range of his deadly hook, long enough for
teammates to capitalize on the moment and burst down the foe while the
Devil locks him down.
</p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Cyanide / Jinx, The Loose
Cannon</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gP_EEywPHD8" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"Rules are made to be broken... like buildings! Or
people!"</em>
</p>
<p>For Jinx, the Loose Cannon isn’t just a nickname, it's an
understatement. Experiencing a surge of popularity from the TV series
Arcane, Jinx can prove she also excels in the actual game as one of the
best late game carries you can rely on. The auto-attack reliant
champion strives in the midst of chaos supplying a barrage of bullets
and cannons on the enemies from afar. But because of her frailty and
dependence on items, she may have a pretty hard time in the first 10
minutes of the game, but if you let her rack up Exp. points and gold,
you will suffer.</p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Zekaida / Zed, The Master
of Shadows</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Heqx1KERNqM" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"I am the blade in the darkness."</em>
</p>
<p>Zed, arguably the most popular champion in the game,
especially because he appeared in the most famous League of Legends
highlight of all time, both as the victor and the vanquished. As one of
the hardest champions in the game, Zed never disappoints, it is merely
in the capability of the player to take advantage of his brute power to
single handedly win games. As an assassin, Zed always seeks out
high-priority targets who he can kill in under a second to disable the
damage capability of the enemy team, while getting away unscaved. Zed
takes years of practice to master, but being one of the most fun
champions to play in the entire game, the benefits of proficiency are
endless.</p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Bionic Ace 2 / Ivern, The
Greenfather</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFrj757yDvY" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"I tread lightly so as not to hurt the dandelions."</em>
</p>
<p>Treading away from the champions who relish in brutal
murder, Ivern sheds a dim tone and welcomes all players of all skill
levels to play him. Although not as popular as the ranks of those
mentioned above, playing Ivern brings a breath of fresh air to those
willing to give him a try. Although a champion who excels in the
Jungle, Ivern carves out a niche as the only enchanter jungler in the
game, graciously giving out shields and dashes to champions who have a
hard time surviving in a teamfight. Ivern is far from dependent though,
as his best friend Daisy, could be summoned to give out an all-out
pummeling. <sub>(ok not too nice after all)</sub></p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Ornn ,The Mountainsmith</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RT6T31GQxaw" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel."</em>
</p>
<p>While Ornn might be secluded and ill-tempered on the outside, but being
    his teammate is a straight up blessing. What's more to ask? He can set
    up extremely good teamfights with his ultimate ability, as well as
    disabling the enemy with his unique status affliction named Brittle, 
    he causes great joy when seen in your own team and malice if seen on the
    enemy. But there’s more! With Ornn, you can channel your inner blacksmith
    by making custom items for your team to make them stronger, giving you a 
    permanent advantage against the enemy team. Remember that he can do all this
    even if he is behind. So if you want consistency, pick up Ornn and you’ll have a great time.
</p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Shaco, The Demon Jester</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l51H0H62or0"

</iframe>
<p><em>"Now you see me, now you don't!"</em>
</p>
<p>Clowns are so many people’s nightmares, but you know what’s worse than a clown? 
A clown possessed by a demonic entity hell-bent on watching the world burn. Unlike
other champions, Shaco does not specialize in damage or teamfights, he capitalizes
on something far, far worse. FRUSTRATION. Shaco is possibly the most annoying champion
in the game with a bevy of tricks up his sleeve, which include invisibility, scary boxes
and a clone just for good measure. Be warned though, Shaco is so annoying don’t be
surprised if people flame you for picking him, even your teammates will look at you 
in disgust, but who are they to stop you?
</p>
<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Braum, The Heart of the Freljord</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHaPr8HpMAk"
 title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
 clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"The darker the night the brighter the stars."</em>
</p>
<p>If there is one champion who is defined by protecting their friends and  throwing 
themselves into the brunt of dangers it has got to be Braum. He has a huge shield for 
Christ’s sake. While most other champions tend to be selfish and reclusive, Braum stands 
as a pillar of hope to those who have given up their quest to win the game. If Braum 
picks a specific member of his team to protect, rest assured, they will not die on his 
watch. Nothing can go through his unbreakable will and shield and if it gets tough, he 
won’t hesitate to make the ultimate sacrifice to win the game, and maybe even your heart : )

If you need help, just call Braum.

<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Pantheon, The Unbreakable Spear</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbRzfz2N2Oc" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"The heavens do not fear me because I am a god. They 
    fear me because I am a man!"</em>
</p>
<p>The peerless warrior known as Pantheon is a nigh-unstoppable paragon of battle. Once an
 unwilling host to the Aspect of War, Atreus survived when the celestial power within him
was slain, refusing to succumb to a blow that tore stars from the heavens. In time, he learned 
to embrace the power of his own mortality, and the stubborn resilience that goes along with it. 
Atreus now opposes the divine as Pantheon reborn, his unbreakable will fueling the fallen Aspect's 
weapons on the field of battle.</p>

<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Yasuo, The Unforgiven</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ygN-vMQu2Yg" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"Honor is in the heart not the name."</em>
</p>
<p>Yasuo is a name infamous for his difficulty and his contradictory popularity, and by popular 
    i’m talking about the most used champion in the entire game, type of popular. Though far from 
    consistent, streamers and pros like Moe, Pz Zang and Arkadata have etched their names in immortality 
    because of their unbelievable proficiency on the Wind Samurai. Many young budding players get into 
    the game because of the awe factor on Yasuo when seen in highlights, only to fall into misery when 
    discovering the true hardships of using the actual champion. But just like Zed, master this champion 
    and the rewards will be endless.
</p>

<strong><h6><p style="font-size:30px">Jhin, The Virtuoso</p></h6></strong>
<iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oywQIKXfZvA" 
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p><em>"Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me."</em>
</p>
<p>Dubbed as the greatest designed champion in the game, Jhin will never disappoint. Though released in 2016,
    his lore, gameplay, kit and fun factor is still unrivaled even until this day. Riot’s magnum opus is far 
    from just smoke and mirrors. His kit is stemmed from snipers from FPS games so you better have good aim! 
    But as a sniper you know his bullets will hurt, <b>a lot</b>. He has everything, traps, mobility, lockdown and 
    brute force. Not to mention his ultimate, Curtain Call. Forcing enemies to dance in his own sick stage 
    being sprayed with 4 bullets, with each one being stronger and faster than the last. Jhin is a delusional 
    murderer that aims for a perfect performance, do your best to not disappoint him.
